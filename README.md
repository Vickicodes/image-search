# What it does
A user searches for an image, the app then uses an API to return a list of related images from unsplash.com

The Image Card component reaches into the DOM to get the image height of each individual image, it then sets the height on state causing the image to re-render when it dynamically assigns a 'grid-row-end' to ensure the image takes up the appropriate amount of space
